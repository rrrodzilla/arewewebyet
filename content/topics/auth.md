title = "Authorization/Authentication"

[extra]

intro = "Authorization and Authentication are a big deal for web development. Take OAuth, the most widely used protocol of authentication between services on the web. Such an simple idea, but with so many varying implementations (twitter, facebook, whatever...) and tricky parts in the details â€“ it's almost impossible to get right without a library. Luckily, these crates will help you address authentication problems. For crates hashing and algorithm crates, see: [Cryptography](https://www.arewewebyet.org/topics/crypto/)"
